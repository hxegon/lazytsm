## TODOS
- [x] Config file
- [x] extra directories
- [x] Sort by .git/objects modtime
- [x] Shorten $HOME parts of path to ~
- [x] use standard cmd/ folder
- [ ] List project tmux sessions, differentiate list items ( No duplicates of standard projects! )
- [ ] Use a table instead of a list, will allow things like displaying git status, type of project, last switched etc.
- [ ] Store timestamp when a selecting a session, and use it to sort by most recently used
- [ ] Parse ssh host config and have a way to start / reattach to a session on a remote host
- [ ] command line args
- [ ] start in filter mode

## Waiting
- [ ] nix build
  - I want to release this in nixpkgs but after trying to use `gomod2nix` I'm realising I have a lot to learn
    before I feel comfortable doing that.
